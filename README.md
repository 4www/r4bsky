# Radio4000 for AT Protocol

Radio4000 for AT Protocol is a SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 application that lets you save your favorite music links as custom AT Protocol records and play them inside a modern web player. The app focuses on personal collections (the shared timeline will return later) and ships as a static bundle that can live on GitHub Pages, Cloudflare, or any static host.

## Features
- **AT Protocol OAuth** – secure sign-in powered by `@atproto/oauth-client-browser`, no passwords required. The session layer automatically handles loopback vs HTTPS clients.
- **Track management** – create, browse, edit, and delete `com.radio4000.track` records with metadata pulled from oEmbed providers and optional Discogs lookups.
- **Built-in player** – queue, shuffle, and control tracks from YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, or direct file links via `src/lib/player/store.ts` and `src/lib/components/Player.svelte`.
- **Discogs helpers** – paste a Discogs release/master URL to fetch suggested hashtags or open a pre-filled Discogs search when you already know the artist/title.
- **Favorites and theming** – follow radios via `com.radio4000.favorite`, manage palette preferences stored in `com.radio4000.profile`, and load the theme automatically on login.
- **I18n + UI kit** – English and French translations live in `src/lib/i18n`, and interface components are built on a small shadcn-inspired kit under `src/lib/components/ui`.

## Tech stack
- [SvelteKit 2](https://kit.svelte.dev/) with Svelte 5 runes and Vite 7
- Static adapter with pre-rendered public routes (`npm run build` writes to `dist/`)
- TypeScript everywhere (`src` is ESM, `type: module` package)
- Tailwind & shadcn-svelte primitives for styling
- `@atproto/api` + `@atproto/oauth-client-browser` for Bluesky API access

## Getting started
### Requirements
- Node.js 20+ (LTS) and npm 10+

### Install & run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

The dev server automatically falls back to the loopback OAuth client, so local HTTP works without extra configuration. When you deploy or expose the app via HTTPS you must serve a `client-metadata.json` file (see below).

## Project scripts
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server in SPA mode. |
| `npm run build` | Build the static site to `dist/` using the default metadata in `static/client-metadata.json`. |
| `npm run build:github` | Copy `static/client-metadata.production.json` into place (GitHub Pages metadata) and build. |
| `npm run build:cloudflare` | Copy `static/client-metadata.cloudflare.json`, clear `R4_BASE`, and build for Cloudflare. |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally. |
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest suite (unit/component tests). |

Set `R4_BASE` when you need to override the base path (the default is `/r4atproto` for production builds so GitHub Pages works out of the box).

## OAuth & client metadata
`src/routes/+layout.svelte` loads `client-metadata.json` from the published site root. Update the copy under `static/client-metadata.json` (and any environment-specific variants in `static/`) before building.

Minimum metadata requirements:

```json
{
  "client_id": "https://your.domain/client-metadata.json",
  "application_type": "web",
  "redirect_uris": [
    "https://your.domain/",
    "https://your.domain"
  ],
  "authorization_details_types": ["atproto_repo"],
  "scope": "atproto"
}
```

## Routes & flows
| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Hub/sign-in and list of favorites once authenticated. |
| `/add` and `/@me/add` | Track creation form with Discogs helpers. |
| `/@<handle>` | View a radio, play tracks, and open Discogs data if attached. |
| `/@<handle>/<rkey>` | Track detail, including Discogs resource embeds. |
| `/search` | Look up users/handles. |
| `/settings` | Review permissions, theme prefs, and session state. |

## Project layout
- `src/lib/components` – shared UI (player, track cards, state cards, Discogs widgets, etc.).
- `src/lib/services` – AT Protocol helpers (`bsky-oauth`, `r4-service`, `oembed`, `discogs`, URL parsing).
- `src/lib/player` – lightweight player store with shuffle/next helpers.
- `src/lib/state` – session and theme stores hydrated from OAuth/profile records.
- `src/routes` – SvelteKit pages using runes (`/`, `/add`, `/search`, `/settings`, `/@handle`, nested track routes).
- `static/` – `client-metadata.json` variants used during builds.

## Data model & services
- `com.radio4000.track` – the library record for each music link. CRUD lives in `src/lib/services/r4-service.ts`.
- `com.radio4000.favorite` – map of DID → favorite radios, surfaced on the home page.
- `com.radio4000.profile` – theme palette + mode preferences.

`src/lib/services/r4-service.ts` handles DID resolution, DPoP retries, Discogs lookups, favorites, and theme persistence. The Discogs helper lives in `src/lib/services/discogs.ts` and is used by `TrackForm` and `DiscogsResource`.

## Testing
Run `npm test` to execute the Vitest suite. The tests currently cover utility/services modules; feel free to add component tests under `src/lib/components` using the happy-dom environment defined in `vitest.config.js`.

## Troubleshooting
- **OAuth redirect mismatch** – confirm that the published `client-metadata.json` includes the exact URL you are serving (add both trailing and non-trailing slash variants for GitHub Pages or other subpath hosts).
- **DPoP nonce errors** – retries are built in, but if you still see failures, reload after a few seconds; PDSs occasionally rotate nonces during local dev.
- **Missing scopes** – the app surfaces a "Missing permission" message when the AS rejected your authorization_details request. Open Settings, re-consent, or temporarily remove `authorization_details_types` from the metadata file.

## Additional documentation
- `README_ATPROTO.md` – quick overview tailored to AT Protocol builders.
- `OAUTH_SETUP.md` – detailed instructions for hosting `client-metadata.json` (loopback, ngrok, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare, etc.).
- `AUTH_COMPARISON.md` – notes comparing OAuth client implementations.
